# Sublime Text 3 Settings

My Favourite Settings for [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

Required packages should be installed via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) which can now be installed from within [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) via the `Install Package Control` command.

The settings file is [here](https://github.com/CapeGuy-Ben/Sublime-Text-3-Settings/blob/master/Preferences.sublime-settings).
